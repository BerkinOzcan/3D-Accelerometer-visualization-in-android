# 3D Accelerometer visualization in android
Accelerometer visualization in android device using processing android mode and Ketai library.
This processsing sketch uses Ketai library to acces sensors in the device and shows a ball hanging on a string in 3D.
It involves some basic vector math to draw in 3D.
I write these kind of programs for fun and to challenge myself, it's not useful in anyway lol.
